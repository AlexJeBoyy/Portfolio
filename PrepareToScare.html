                A game where you can customize your own zombie to go scare at Halloween. This game was made at a 3 day
                Gamejam. I really liked working on this game and this was my first project where I worked with somebody
                else to make the assets.
                When working on this project I struggled a lot with the time constraints so i worked on it for a long
                period of time.
                I made all the code which was a lot of work, but I also learned a lot from it. The game is made in Unity
                and the art is made in Procreate and Aseprite.
                All assets made by Charlotte, Insta: @ijslandertjuh.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>When coding this project I learned a lot about working with lists, saving information to the next
                scene and making a screenshot and saving it.
                I struggled the most with taking a screenshot and saving it, because I had to make sure that the
                screenshot was saved in the right format and that it was saved in the right place.
